==========

Graft HTTP/REST integration

For now, this service is meant to provide the minimal amount of glue code needed to accomplish these objectives.

1. Serve an HTTP request using a Graft-based back-end.
2. Make an HTTP request with a Graft message.
3. Cleaner way to bootstrap Graft websocket servers.

There is a lot of stream-based code out there that allows you to work with
HTTP services, and we aim to be compatible with them.
